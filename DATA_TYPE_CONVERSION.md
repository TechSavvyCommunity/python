# Data Type Conversion
Sometimes, we need to perform conversion between the built-in types. To convert between types, you simply use the type name as a function. <br>
There are several built-in functions to perform conversion from one data type to another. These functions return a new object representing the converted value. <br>
| S. No.  | Function & Description  |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1.  | int(x [,base]) <br> Converts x to an integer. base specifies the base if x is a string. |
| 2.  | long(x[,base]) <br> Converts x to a long integer, base specifies the base if x is a string. |
| 3.  | float(x) <br> Converts x to a floating point number.  |
| 4.  | complex(real[,imag]) <br> Creates a complex number. |
| 5.  | str(x) <br> Converts object x to a string representation. |
| 6.  | repr(x) <br> Converts object x to an expression string. |
| 7.  | eval(str) <br> Evaluates a string and returns an object.  |
