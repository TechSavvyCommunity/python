## Overview
* Python is a high level, interpreted, interactive and object oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
* Python is interpreted - Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
* Python is interactive - You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
* Python is Object-Oriented - Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
* Python is a Beginner's Language - Python is a great language for the beginner level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to game.

## Where can we see Python in action?
We see it everyday and almost everywhere. It's used extenssively to implement complex <b>Internet services </b> like search engines, cloud storage and tools, social media and so on. Whenever you use any of these services, you are actually very close to Python, although you wouldn't know it.
Many <b> developing tools </b> are implemented in Python. More and more <b> everyday use applications </b> are being written in Python. Lots of <b> scientists </b> have abandoned expensive proprietary tools and switched to Python. Lots of IT project <b> testers </b> have started using Python to carry out repeatable test procedures. The list is long.
