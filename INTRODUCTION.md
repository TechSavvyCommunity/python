# INTRODUCTION
Python is widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general – purpose programming.
And while you know the python as a large snake, the name 	of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python’s Flying Circus.
As the height of its success, the Monty Python team were performing their sketches to live audiences across the world, including at the Hollywood Bowl.
Since Monty Python is considered one of the two fundamental nutrients to a programmer (the other being pizza), Python’s creator named the language in honour of the TV show.

## Who created Python?
One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person’s work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception.
There are not many languages whose authors are known by name. Python was created by GUIDO VAN ROSSUM, born in 1956 in Haarlem, the Netherlands. Of course, Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself.
The speed with which Python has spread around the world is a result of the continuous work of thousands (very often anonymous) programmers, testers, users (many of them aren’t IT specialist) and enthusiasts, but it must be said that the very first idea (the seed from which Python sprouted) came to one head – Guido’s.

## Characteristics of Python
1. It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
2. It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
3. It provides very high - level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
4. It supports automatic garbage collection.
5. It can be easily integerated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, COBRA, and Java.

## Applications of Python
* Easy-to-learn - Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
* Easy-to-read - Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
* Easy-to-maintain - Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
* Extendable - You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add or to customize their tools to be more efficient.
* Databses - Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
* GUI Programming - Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and window systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of UNIX.
* Scalable - Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
* A broad standard library - Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
* Interactive Mode - Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
* Portable - Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
