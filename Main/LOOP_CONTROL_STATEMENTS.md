# Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed. <br>
Python supports the following control statements:
| S.No. | Control Statement | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.  | break statement | Terminates the loop statement and transfer execution to the statement immediately following the loop. |
| 2.  | continue statement  | Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately resets its condition prior to reiterating. |
| 3.  | pass statement  | It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute. |
