# Decision Making
Decision making is anticipation of conditions occuring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions. <br>
Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if TRUE or FALSE otherwise. <br>
Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages - <br>
Python progamming language assumes any non - zero and non - null values as TRUE, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as FALSE value. <br>
Python programming language provides following types of decision making statements.
| S.NO. | STATEMENT | DESCRIPTION |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.  | if statements | An if statements consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements. | 
| 2.  | if...else statements | An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is FALSE. |
