# Operators
Operators are the symbols that tells the computer to perform specific manipulations.

## Types of Operators
Python supports the following types of operators:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Comparison (Realtional) Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Logical Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* Membership Operators
* Identity Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
**An arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.** <br>
Assume variable a = 20 and b = 30, then: <br>
| S.No. | Operator | Name  | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.  | + | Addition  | Adds values on either side of the operator  | a + b = 50 |
| 2.  | - | Subtraction | Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand | a - b = -10 |
| 3.  | * | Multiplication  | Multiplies values on either side of the operator  | a * b = 600 |
| 4.  | / | Division  | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand | b / a = 1.5 |
| 5.  | % | Modulus | Divides left hand operand by right hand operator and returns remainder  | b % a = 10  |
| 6.  | **  | Exponent  | Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators | a ** b = 20 to the power 30 |
| 7.  | //  | Floor Division  | The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal points are removed. But if one of the operand is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity) |  9 // 2 = 4 and 9.0 // 2.0 = 4.0, -11 // 3 = -4, -11.0 / /3 = -4.0 |

## Comparison Operators
These operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called relational operators. <br>
Assume variable a = 20 and b = 30, then: <br>
| S.No. | Operator | Name  | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.  | ==  | Equal | If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true. | (a == b) is not true  |
| 2.  | !=  | Not Equal | If values of two operands are not equal, then the condition becomes true. | (a != b) is true  |
| 3.  | > | Greater Than  | If the value of the left operand is greater, than the the value of right operand, then the condition becomes true. |  (a > b) is not true |
| 4.  | < | Less Than | If the value of the left operand is less, than the value of right operand, then the condition becomes true. | (a < b) is true |
| 5.  | >=  | Greater Than or Equal To  | If the value of the left operand is greater than or equals to the value of the right operand, then the condition becomes true.  | (a >= b) is not true. |
| 6.  | <=  | Less Than or Equal To | If the value of the lest operand is less than or equals to the value of the right operand, then the condition becomes true. | (a <= b) is true  |
