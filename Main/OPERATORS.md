# Operators
Operators are the symbols that tells the computer to perform specific manipulations.

## Types of Operators
Python supports the following types of operators:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Comparison (Realtional) Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Logical Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* Membership Operators
* Identity Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
**An arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.** <br>
Assume variable a = 20 and b = 30, then: <br>
| S.No. | Operators | Name  | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.  | + | Addition  | Adds values on either side of the operator  | a + b = 50 |
| 2.  | - | Subtraction | Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand | a - b = -10 |
| 3.  | * | Multiplication  | Multiplies values on either side of the operator  | a * b = 600 |
| 4.  | / | Division  | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand | b / a = 1.5 |
| 5.  | % | Modulus | Divides left hand operand by right hand operator and returns remainder  | b % a = 10  |
| 6.  | **  | Exponent  | Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators | a ** b = 20 to the power 30 |
| 7.  | //  | Floor Division  | The division of operands where the result is the quotient <br> in which the digits after the operands |  |
