# Operators
Operators are the symbols that tells the computer to perform specific manipulations.

## Types of Operators
Python supports the following types of operators:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Comparison (Realtional) Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Logical Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* Membership Operators
* Identity Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
**An arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.** <br>
Assume variable a = 20 and b = 30, then: <br>
| S.No. | Operators | Name  | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.  | + | Addition  | Adds values on either side of the operator  | a + b = 50 |
| 2.  | - | Subtraction | Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand | a - b = -10 |
| 3.  | * | Multiplication  | Multiplies values on either side of the operator  | a * b = 600 |
| 4.  | / | Division  | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand | b / a = 1.5 |
| 5.  | % | Modulus | Divides left hand operand by right hand operator and returns remainder  | b % a = 10  |
| 6.  | **  | Exponent  | Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators | a ** b = 20 to the power 30 |
| 7.  | //  | Floor Division  | The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal points are removed. But if one of the operand is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity) |  9 // 2 = 4 and 9.0 // 2.0 = 4.0, -11 // 3 = -4, -11.0 / /3 = -4.0 |
